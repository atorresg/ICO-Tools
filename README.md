# ICO Tools

Estimate some parameters for **token** and **crowdsale** contracts are frequently difficult due to the big numbers and different calculations implied. ICO Tools is made to help in the creation and test of these calculations. It is based on jquery and bootstrap (and some server-side scripts).

Many inputs have a [ ? ] symbol describing functionalities on mouse hover.

A demo can be found here: http://ico.atorresg.com/

## TO-DO

- Improve of front-end: better mobile support and overall design
- Optimization of server API calls (just returning actual ETH value x times a day instead of same value per session)
- Would be interesting to implement  account creation for multiple project management
